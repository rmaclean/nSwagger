# Examples

This folder contains a number of Swagger 2.0 definition files. Each file in here has been processed using nSwagger available to produce a TypeScript definition for the Swagger definition and a C# client class for the Swagger definition.  

The TypeScript files are found within [TS-Examples](TS-Examples) and the C# files are found within [C#-Examples](C#-Examples).

A good place to start is with the standard [PetStore](petstore.json) Swagger example, which generated to the following:  
- [TypeScript Definition](TS-Examples/petstore.ts)  
- [C# client](C%23-Examples/petstore.cs)
